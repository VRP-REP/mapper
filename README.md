# Mapper
Mapper let's users visualize datasets (problem instances) and solutions (routes) that are formatted according to the Vehicle Routing Problem REPository (VRP-REP) specification.

More about VRP-REP and the specification can be found on their [website](http://vrp-rep.org/).

## To use
From the [Mapper landing page](https://vrp-rep.github.io/mapper/), use the "Upload Instance" button to browse to and select a VRP-REP compliant dataset.

![Upload instance][uploadInstance]

[uploadInstance]: ./assets/images/uploadInstance.PNG "Upload instance"

Once you have uploaded an instance, the upload solution functionality becomes available.
